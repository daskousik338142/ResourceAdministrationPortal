# Resource Evaluation Dashboard - Active Evaluations Logic Verification

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS: CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED

The Active Evaluations calculation is already working exactly as requested. The logic counts records only when **at least one status is "pending" or "inprogress"**.

## 🔍 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Current Logic (Lines 272-277 in resourceEvaluations.js):

```javascript
const activeEvaluations = evaluations.filter(e => 
  e.internal_evaluation_status === 'pending' || 
  e.internal_evaluation_status === 'inprogress' ||
  e.client_evaluation_status === 'pending' || 
  e.client_evaluation_status === 'inprogress'
);
```

### This Logic Counts a Record as "Active" When:

1. **Internal status is "pending"** (regardless of client status)
2. **Internal status is "inprogress"** (regardless of client status)  
3. **Client status is "pending"** (regardless of internal status)
4. **Client status is "inprogress"** (regardless of internal status)
5. **Any combination** of the above conditions

### This Logic Does NOT Count a Record as "Active" When:

- Both internal AND client statuses are "pass" or "fail" (completed evaluations)
- Neither status is "pending" or "inprogress"

## 🧪 TEST RESULTS

### Test Data Analysis:
- **Total Evaluations**: 3
- **Active Evaluations**: 2
- **Completed Evaluations**: 1

### Active Records Breakdown:
1. **Record 1**: aaaaaaaaaa (1111111)
   - Internal: pending
   - Client: pending
   - **Active because**: Both statuses are pending

2. **Record 2**: sadsa (123456)
   - Internal: fail  
   - Client: pending
   - **Active because**: Client status is pending (even though internal is complete)

### Completed Record:
1. **Record 3**: [Name not shown in test]
   - Internal: pass/fail
   - Client: pass/fail
   - **Not active**: Both statuses are complete

## 📊 DASHBOARD FEATURES

### ✅ Features Already Working:
- **Auto-updating analytics** from database (no manual refresh needed)
- **Real-time Active Evaluations count** using correct logic
- **Aging analytics** for active evaluations only
- **Completion status breakdown**
- **Pass/fail analytics** for both internal and client evaluations
- **Recent activity tracking**

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements Already Applied:
- Removed dashboard subtitle and refresh button
- Analytics auto-update from database
- Proper card layout and styling
- Dashboard placed in main Dashboard menu (not Resource Evaluation submenu)

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

The Active Evaluations logic is **already correctly implemented** and working as requested:

- ✅ Counts records where **at least one status** is "pending" or "inprogress"  
- ✅ Does not count records where **both statuses** are complete
- ✅ Auto-updates from database without manual refresh
- ✅ Provides accurate real-time metrics

**No changes needed** - the system is working correctly!

## 📋 VERIFICATION COMMANDS

The following test scripts confirm the implementation:

```bash
# Test Active Evaluations logic
node test-active-evaluations-logic.js

# Test complete dashboard logic
node test-dashboard-logic-verification.js
```

Both tests confirm that the Active Evaluations calculation is working correctly and counting only records where at least one status is "pending" or "inprogress".
